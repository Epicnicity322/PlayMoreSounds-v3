Changes with * at the start are the ones that are currently under development, the rest is already added.

Sound playing changes:
- Add radius -3: Plays sound to all players in the world, but not globally.
- Sounds will avoid checking for players spectator game mode and invisibility effect if the radius is already set to 0, improving performance.
- PlaySoundEvent was reworked so it isn't called for every listener, this considerably improves sound playing performance.
- PlaySoundEvent and PlayRichSoundEvent classes were moved to the same package as Playable sounds, this allows the sounds to get the event's location without calling Location#clone, saving performance.

Regions:
- Complete overhaul region commands to fix issues and do minor optimizations.
- Fix error if there is a console-made region present and you try to create a region without the permission 'playmoresounds.region.create.unlimited.regions'.
- Fix error if you try to get info of a region from a player that was purged from the server's files.
- Remove "description" as an alias for info region command to avoid confusion.
- Add "/pms region set sounds" command to allow players to add sounds to their own regions in-game through a GUI.
- Made so "/pms region list" accepts offline players as arguments, and "CONSOLE/null" to list console-made regions.
*- Regions will now store enter/leave/loop sounds in their own data files, instead of regions.yml. Once you update, PlayMoreSounds will detect if there are valid region sounds in your old regions.yml file, then ask you to confirm the automatic conversion to the new place of region sounds.

Sound Editing GUI:
- You can now edit sounds using a GUI!
- Use the command /pms edit to navigate through sounds.yml sounds and edit them.
- Inputs will be given through a fancy Anvil inventory.
*- In a region you can use the command /pms rg set sound to set a sound to play in this region, for loop, enter or leave.

Fixes:
- Fix log sounds dev option giving an error when the entity making a sound is null.
- Fix addons inventory not being able to be open after an error.
- Fix addons inventory giving key not found when informing the user that the latest addons are unsupported, and the addons made for the current PlayMoreSounds version will be downloaded.

What to expect of 5.0:
*- There were major changes to the api and configurations.
*- Specific sound configurations were renamed.
*- Sounds that were tasked to play later due to a delay can now be stopped, in case you're leaving a region for example.
*- Addon code had several changes to allow it to be restartable and stoppable with start and stop commands.

*Radio Feature:
- You can now assign a sound to play in a specific location or the whole world in loop.
- Enabling the Synchronize Sounds option makes so all players hear sounds at the same time.
- If a player has entered the world AFTER the sound was played, the sound will play anyway but stop right before the next loop. This way the sound is always heard by all players.
