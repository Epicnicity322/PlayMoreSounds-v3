Changelog:
- Add sound list when you try to tab complete /pms play command.
- Add sound categories to 'available sounds.txt'
- Add "/pms update download [-force]" command to allow downloads of new updates through api.spiGET.org.
- Add 1.18 sounds that were missing.
- Add way of uninstalling addons through Addon Management Inventory or the command /pms addons uninstall <addon>.
- Addons descriptions will break lines if the description is too long in Addon Management Inventory.
- Considerably lower memory usage by instantiating things only when using them, instead of eating all memory when the plugin loads.
- Improve performance considerably when checking for region wand when the player left or right clicks.
- Improve resource packer feature:
  - If a player is trying to join and constantly failing to download the resource pack (when Force is on), admins with the permission 'playmoresounds.resourcepacker.administrator' will be prompted to type "/pms confirm" to allow this player to join without a resource pack.
  - In supported versions, the "accept resource pack" message will be shown in the prompt rather than chat. Also removed PlayMoreSounds prefix from this message.
  - You can specify a hash to improve resource pack loading.
  - Players with permission 'playmoresounds.resourcepacker.force.bypass' will be able to decline even when Force is on.
  - The message will be different if resource pack failed to download.
- Made addons start and stop on main thread to fix some synchronization issues.
- Made Custom Discs feature an addon due to low usage on bStats. Use /pms addons to download the addon and use this feature again.
- Made biome sounds take login event into account.
- Made so Addons and List GUIs use the same way of handling inventories. This means List GUI is now compatible with all versions, has better performance and less bugs.
- Made so when you type region removal command multiple times, the confirmation will no longer repeat on "/pms confirm list".
- Made update checker reload on /pms reload, plus huge changes and simplification of update checker.
- Renamed multiple configuration keys for List and Addon GUIs.
- Rewrote "wait for resource pack accept/decline before playing custom sound" code, also add support for biome sounds. This also fixes minecraft sounds not playing at login in case the player declines the resource pack.
- Update chinese language thanks to AndyYu.
